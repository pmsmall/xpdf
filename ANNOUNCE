Subject: ANNOUNCE: xpdf 0.93 - a PDF viewer for X


I've just released a new version of xpdf, my Portable Document Format
(PDF) viewer for X.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components of the package (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32
systems.

Noticeable changes:

* Embed TrueType fonts in PostScript output.  (Added a "-noembtt" flag
  to pdftops.)
* Implement PDF 1.4 (128-bit) decryption.
* Bump supported PDF version number to 1.4.
* Text output for Simplified Chinese.  [Thanks to Cheung Siu Fai.]
* Read an app-defaults file for Xpdf.  Read a system-wide config file
  (<prefix>/etc/xpdfrc) if ~/.xpdfrc doesn't exist.
* Accept and verify owner password; if correct, allow all actions.
* Added a "-level2sep" option to pdftops to generate Level 2 separable
  PostScript.  The PostScript separation convention operators are used
  to handle custom (spot) colors.  [Thanks to Thomas Freitag for help
  on this.]
* Add support for FreeType 2 to the configure script.  Warning: this
  requires FT 2.0.5 or newer (see the INSTALL file for details).

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:

    http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/
    ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/

Source and Linux binaries are on sunsite.unc.edu, currently in
the incoming directory, but they will be moved to:

    ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/X

Subject: ANNOUNCE: xpdf 0.80 - a PDF viewer for X


I've just released a new version of xpdf, my Portable Document Format
(PDF) viewer for X.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components of the package (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32
systems.

!!! Please note my new email/web/ftp addresses. !!!

The most noticeable changes are:

* Support for some Japanese fonts (Type 0 fonts using the
  Adobe-Japan1-2 character collection, horizontal only).
* Added pdfinfo application.
* Added pdftopbm application.
* Added pdfimages application.
* Xpdf is now licensed under the GPL.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, or OS/2.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:

    http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/
    ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/

Source and Linux binaries are on sunsite.unc.edu, currently in
the incoming directory, but they will be moved to:

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/X

The following will be available soon --

    RPM packages for RedHat 5.x Linux systems:
        ftp://contrib.redhat.com/

    Decryption patches:
        ftp://ftp.sci.usq.edu.au/pub/linux/xpdf/

    Decryption-enabled Linux binaries:
        ftp://ftp.replay.com/pub/replay/linux/redhat/

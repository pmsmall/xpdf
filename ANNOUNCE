Subject: ANNOUNCE: xpdf 0.90 - a PDF viewer for X


I've just released a new version of xpdf, my Portable Document Format
(PDF) viewer for X.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components of the package (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32
systems.

*** NEW -- Anti-aliased fonts!
*** This release uses t1lib to render embedded Type 1/1C fonts (and
*** the base 14 fonts).

Other noticeable changes:

* Added "backward" and "forward" buttons.
* Added fit-page and fit-page-width zoom factors.
* Type 1C fonts are converted to Type 1 and embedded in PostScript.
* Support vertical Japanese text.
* Added Japanese text support (EUC-JP) to pdftotext.
* Initial support for PDF 1.3.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:

    http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/
    ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/

Source and Linux binaries are on sunsite.unc.edu, currently in
the incoming directory, but they will be moved to:

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/X

The following will be available soon --
